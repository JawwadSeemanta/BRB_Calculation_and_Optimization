# BRB_Calculation_and_Optimization
This is a coding assignment done for course M175 - Intelligent Decision Technology of University of Chittagong. 

- Uses Disjunctive BRB to calculate rules and weights.
- Uses the "Analytical Method" to compute the aggregated Belief degrees of a Belief Rule Base (BRB) System 
- Uses "fmincon" function of MATLAB Optimization Toolbox to implement the optimization of Belief Degree Matrix 
- Optimization is done to get least mean squared error.

This code uses a training set with 4(T) attributes and 12(M) input-output pair. 
To solve, it takes 3(N) referencial values High, Medium, Low with utility values 1.0, 0.5, 0.0.
